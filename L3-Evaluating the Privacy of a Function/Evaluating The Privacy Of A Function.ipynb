    "Intuitively, we want to be able to query our database and evaluate whether or not the result of the query is leaking \"private\" information. As mentioned previously, this is about evaluating whether the output of a query changes when we remove someone from the database. Specifically, we want to evaluate the maximum amount the query changes when someone is removed (maximum over all possible people who could be removed). So, in order to **evaluate how much privacy is leaked**, we're going to iterate over each person in the database and measure the difference in the output of the query relative to when we query the entire database.\n",
